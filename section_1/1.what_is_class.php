  Class is a blueprint of an object.
  Class is a logical grouping of code with variables and functions specific to that Object.

  The main purpose of the class is to organize your code nto individual components.

  How to define a class.
  1. Identify how can you organize your code into objects.
  Ex. Users, Database, Files, Posts
  2. Then start grouping those into classes.
  3. Each class has variables and function into related individual objects.
  4. One Class will holds many variables and functions but it logically represent that Object.

  Think how to organize
  Ex. User class
  What will be the variables?
  1. Name
  2. Age
  What will be the fnctions?
  1. Set the name
  2. Set the age
  3. Display the name and Age
